# Unreal Engine Live Project
During my time at the Tech Academy I working on a live project to build a game in the Unreal Engine. This was a two week sprint and the code was consisted entirely of Unreal Engines Blue print scripts.
This was an apprenticship done for [Prosper IT Consulting](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosper-it-consulting/) we participated in daily stand-ups with a small team. The goal was to deliver a minimal viable product by the end. For this MVP I was tasked with creating a sandbox game. I went with a version  of American Ninja Warrior. There were quiet a few mechanics and phyics  that I can to create in order to fully realize this game.

Below are some examples code and logic I have for this project.
## Index

- [Main Menu](#MainMenu)
- [Sprint Logic](#Sprint)
- [Respawn](#Respawn)
- [Timer](#Timer)
- [CheckPoint](#Checkpoint)
- [Ragdoll effect](#Ragdoll)
- [Proficiencies](#Proficiencies)
## MainMenu
  For my Main menu I create an empty level and created a user widget and titled it WB_Title. I first started off by dragging in a Canvas panel where I would later create my buttons to play or quit the game if the player wants.
I kept the title screen basic and focused prodomentily on making her the play and quit buttons work. When the player hit the play button it will load the main game scene title Level01.
