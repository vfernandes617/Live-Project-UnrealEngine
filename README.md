# Unreal Engine Live Project
During my time at the Tech Academy I working on a live project to build a game in the Unreal Engine. This was a two week sprint and the code was to consist entirely of Unreals Blue print scripts.
This was an apprenticship done for [Prosper IT Consulting] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosper-it-consulting/)
